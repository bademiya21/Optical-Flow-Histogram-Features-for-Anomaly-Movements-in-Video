This repository contains codes for a project I did where we detect hypermotor seizures in an unsupervised environment.  This project was developed in Visual Studio 2010. I have not tested if it works in later versions. The solutions files etc has been upgraded to Visual Studio 2015 but I have not compiled to see if it runs. If using, please necessary amendments to get the project to run smoothly.
